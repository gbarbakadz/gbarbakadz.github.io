These tools can be used as replacements for various Windows `net*` commands and more. PowerView and SharpView can help us gather much of the data that BloodHound does, but it requires more work to make meaningful relationships among all of the data points. These tools are great for checking what additional access we may have with a new set of credentials, targeting specific users or computers, or finding some "quick wins" such as users that can be attacked via Kerberoasting or ASREPRoasting. |

## Harnessing PowerShell

| Command                                                      | Description                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Get-Module`                             | Lists available modules loaded for use. |
| `Get-ExecutionPolicy -List`                                     | Will print the execution policy settings for each scope on a host. |
| `Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process`                                | This will change the policy for our current process using the -Scope parameter. Doing so will revert the policy once we vacate the process or terminate it. This is ideal because we won't be making a permanent change to the victim host. |
